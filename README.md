2. **Drop on different team members** to reassign appointments
3. **Conflict detection** will prevent invalid moves and show warnings

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses browser localStorage for data persistence. No external database configuration is required for basic functionality.

### Customization Options

#### Team Members
Edit the team members array in `contexts/AppContext.tsx`:
```typescript
const [teamMembers, setTeamMembers] = useState<TeamMember[]>([
  { id: 1, name: "Alex Johnson", color: "#F5A623" },
  { id: 2, name: "Sarah Wilson", color: "#9AE095" },
  // Add more team members...
]);
```

#### Time Slots
Modify the time slots in `components/CalendarGrid.tsx`:
```typescript
const timeSlots = [
  "6am", "7am", "8am", "9am", "10am", "11am",
  "12pm", "1pm", "2pm", "3pm", "4pm", "5pm", "6pm"
];
```

#### Color Themes
Update colors in `app/globals.css` and component styling to match your brand:
```css
/* Example color customization */
.appointment-completed { background: #EEF6FF; }
.appointment-active { background: #FBF5FF; }
.appointment-pending { background: #FEF7EC; }
```

## 🤝 Contributing

### Development Guidelines
1. **Follow TypeScript best practices** - Use proper typing for all components and functions
2. **Maintain component modularity** - Keep components focused and reusable
3. **Use Tailwind classes** - Avoid custom CSS where possible
4. **Test drag-and-drop functionality** - Ensure all interactions work smoothly
5. **Responsive design** - Test on multiple screen sizes

### Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Ensure proper error handling in modals and forms

### Adding New Features
1. **Create feature branch** from main
2. **Update relevant context** if new state is needed
3. **Add proper TypeScript types** for any new data structures
4. **Test thoroughly** including edge cases and responsive behavior
5. **Update documentation** as needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Calendar not displaying appointments:**
- Check browser localStorage for saved data
- Verify appointment data structure matches TypeScript interfaces
- Ensure team member IDs match between appointments and team members

**Drag and drop not working:**
- Verify @dnd-kit dependencies are properly installed
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
- Ensure collision detection is properly configured

**Filtering not working:**
- Check that filter state is properly connected to components
- Verify filter logic in CalendarGrid component
- Ensure context is properly providing filter states

**Mobile responsiveness issues:**
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Check Tailwind breakpoints are properly applied
- Verify touch events work for drag and drop
